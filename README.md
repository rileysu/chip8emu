# Chip8emu

## Description

A simple Chip8 Emulator I wrote a while ago. I may make some design changes in the future. No license is included because I am not sure who owns the games. A few things such as sound and key input still need to be implemented but demos such as TRIP still work fine

## Usage

~~~
./chip8.out EXECUTABLE
~~~

## Build

Enter the Chip8emu directory
~~~
git clone https://github.com/rileysut8991/rstd
